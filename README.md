# GALAXEV: Galaxy Spectral Evolution Library

Currently, each GALAXEV SSP model is provided as a fits table file. Models are available for the values of the metallicity Z indicated in the table. The 2019 models (Plat et al. 2019; Sánchez et al. 2022) are based on the PARSEC evolutionary tracks (Chen et al. 2015; Marigo et al. 2013). In the CB19 models (a.k.a. C&B models) the evolution of Post AGB stars follows Miller Bertolami (2018) whereas in the BC19 models the Post AGB stars are treated as in Bruzual & Charlot (2003, BC03) following Vassiliadis & Wood (1994). The BC03 models follow the Padova 1994 evolutionary tracks and the CB03 models the Padova 2000 tracks (see BC03 for details). The CB07 models are identical to the BC03 models except for an enhanced contribution from TP-AGB stars (Bruzual 2007a,b).
